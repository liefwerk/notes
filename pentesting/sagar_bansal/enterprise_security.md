# How enterprise security works

In a company's server we would have a few different zones.
DMZ, Internal and Management.

As someone who wants to penetratethe system, you'll be outside of these boxes.
To enter, the company will give you a VPN connexion to enter in their network zone.

You'll get an IP address that coincides with the DMZ zone.
Without being in the same zone we can't communicate.

192.X.X.X, 72.X.X.X and 10.X.X.X are private IPs.
This privates IP is given by the router or switch.

## How to access another zone

Let's say there is a machine in the Interal area that we want to attack.
Because we aren't in the same zone, we can't reach it on our own.
The solution lies on using a pivot in the DMZ zone (a website for example) to attack the Internal Zone.

## How do these ranges work

The adapter will give different IPs, here's an example:

**Range 100**
10.0.100.0/N
**Range 115**
10.0.115.0/N
**Range 150**
10.0.150.0/N
**Range 200**
10.0.200.0/N
