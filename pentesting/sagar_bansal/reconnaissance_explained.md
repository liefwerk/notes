# Reconnaissance Explained

There are two kind of reconnaissance, an active and a passive.
For example if we go on a website called builtwith and search the url of a website, we interact with the target.
We are doing an active reconnaissance. But it we use a search engine or database, that's passive.

Our mission is to hack a webserver with a website called beta.hackerintheouse.com

```bash
whatweb beta.hackerintheouse.com
```

This will give us some information about the website (which technologies).
From this scan we learnt that this is a wordpress website. The next step is to use WPScan to identify vulnarabilities.

```bash
wpscan --url beta.hackerintheouse.com -e vp, vt
```

`vp, vt` tells use if there are vulnerable themes or plugins.

From this scan we found a direct acces through `xmlrpc.php`.
This is a command line tool that allows us to directly communicate with the website.
That will help us to bruteforce and give it commands.

In this case, there are no vulnerabe plugins or themes.
The website is safe.

## Bruteforcing vs Dictionary attack

Bruteforcing is using every characters, this gives us an infinity of passwords.
The issue is time, it could take you years to crack a password with 20 characters.

Dictionary attack only uses dictionary words, there are less choices.
To have a more efficient approach, we could transmute these words.

### Get the users of wordpress

In this case we can easily get the website's users with WPScan.

```bash
wpscan --url beta.hackerintheouse.com -e u
```

This gives us the two following users: `admin` and `developer`.
Targeting the developer account could be a good choice because in general they are more prone on making errors.
Errors such as leaving a connexion between machines unprotected, etc...

### Finding a list of password

We need a list password, a popular one is rockyou.

```bash
locate rockyou
cp rock_ou_path new_path
```

After extracting the file we get a rockyou.txt file. That file has 14 millions passwords.
To try all of them could take us years.
We need to come up with a GREAT word list.

#### Making a custom wordlist
