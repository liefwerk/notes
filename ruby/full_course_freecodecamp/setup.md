# Setup of Ruby

**Hello world time !**

`print"Hello World!"`

We should see `Hello World` in the debugger.

`puts "mytext`" will print the next one in another line

`print "mytext"` will print the next one in the same line

## Drawing up a shape

Let's draw a basic shape:

```ruby
puts "   /|"
puts "  / |"
puts " /  |"
puts "/___|"
```

and this prints

```ruby
   /|
  / |
 /  |
/___|
```

Ruby executes the instructions line by line, in the order that we write them.
