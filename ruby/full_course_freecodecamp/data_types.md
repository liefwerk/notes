# data_types

It is a type of data that we can use inside Ruby.

A **string** is plain text

```ruby
name = "John"
```

An **integer** or **floating point** is a number

```ruby
age = 75
gpa = 3.22
```

A **boolean** is a true/false data type

```ruby
passed_test = true
```

A last type is a **nil** type, when it doesn't have any value

```ruby
flaws = nil
```
