# Setting up Nuxt JS

Nuxt JS is a framework for a framework (Vue JS).
We'll be testing it with a small app fetching dad jokes and outputting it to a page.

## Initiation of the project

To initiate a project we launch it via the console

```bash
npx create-nuxt-app dadjokes
cd dadjokes
```

## Running the server

We then run the server

```bash
npm run dev
```
