# Creating Our VueJS project

## With the Vue CLI

In order to create our first vue project, the client side, we'll use the vue CLI.

If vue CLI isn't installed in your computer, check the reference here.

Once it is installed, you can check that it is properly functionning by launching your terminal and passing this command

```bash
vue create hello-world
```

You'll get prompted a few different options, these will depend of the size of your project and the tools that you know.
