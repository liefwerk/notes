# primitive_vs_reference_types

Primitive types are strings, booleans and numbers - references types are functions, arrays and objects.

If we change some data in a reference type, it will change all the other types distributed in the other components.
In the case of primitive, it will not alter all of them - only the one we are actually updating.
