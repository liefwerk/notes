# Creating a React Application

## Setup
### VS-Code setup
#### Extensions

A nice extension to help get some React snippets is this one:

- Simple React Snippets 

#### Adding more settings

In the `Online Preferences Settings` we search for `emmet` and into the Include Languages field we add `javascript`, `javascriptreact`. This will allow us to use `.hello` to create a div with the class `hello`.

### Course files

The course files are available on the link below:

### Creating an application

A nice way is to use a command tool named `create-react-app`. We'll use node and npx tu run this tool.

From our code directory we write `npx create-react-app dojo-blog`. We then `cd` into the new directory and open it with VSCode with `code .`.

### Launching the app in the browser

To preview the app we have to use the terminal and write `npm run start`.
