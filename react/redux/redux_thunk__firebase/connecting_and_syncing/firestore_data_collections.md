# Firestore Data & Collections

Firestore is a NoSQL database, deals with collections and documents.
Collection is documents joined together. Each document represents a project.
Each document looks like a JS object (key and pairs).

We'll use 3 collections:

## Project collections

* title
* content
* authorFirstName
* authorLastName
* authorId
* timestamp

**User collection**
info about app users

**Notidifations Collection**
info about notifications
