<br/>
Redux is a central data store that shares data between components.<br/>
If we want data, we reach out from the components to the central data store.<br/>
<br/>
There is a process whe we want to alter the data.<br/>
<br/>
We define a central store, where the data ill be kept.<br/>
When we want to access, component siubscribes to changes, redux apasses the data in the form of props.<br/>
<br/>
Changing data is a process, makes it easier to debug.<br/>
<br/>
We decide to change, we dispatch the action. (eg. add post, add name..)<br/>
We can pass a payload (data that we pass along), the data we want to add.<br/>
<br/>
Then the action is passed as a reducer. It looks at the action, takes the data that we need and updates it in the store.</body></html>
