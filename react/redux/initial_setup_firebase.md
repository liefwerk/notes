# Initial Setup of a Firebase Project

We are going to create a React app coupled with Redux and Firebase to learn interactions with database.
The first step is to create the folder, once inside we run this command line to install react

`npx create-react-app`

Setup the Route with `react-router-dom`

`npm i react-router-dom`

Then we import it

`import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'`

And we wrap the JSX with `<BrowserRouter><BrowserRouter />`
