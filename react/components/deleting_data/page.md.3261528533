# Deleting Data  
  
We construct a new function, in this function we'll take the id of the props and apply the `filter()` method. 

```
deleteNinja = (id) => {
  let ninjas = this.state.ninjas.filter(ninja => {
  return ninja.id !== id
    this.setState({
      ninjas: ninjas
    })
  }
}
```
  
*It is important to use setState to apply the change, otherwise it modifies directly the array.*
  
In Ninja.js, we add a button with an onClick attribute to trigger the `deleteNinja()` function.  
  
`<button onClick = {() => { deleteNinja(ninja.id) }}>DeleteNinja</button>`
  
That function is passed inside an anonymous function so it isn't triggered when it is first loaded in the DOM.
